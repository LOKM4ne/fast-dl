**Some info about the map**

- Best played with 100aa;

- Max distance to jump is 256;

- 13 Spawn Places for each team;

- Credits to Notch or whoever made the textures. I only rescaled them and modified them a bit.

- I like my clouds and my water.


**Other Notes**

I know I said I wouldn't make another map for the GoldSRC engine, but it got me in the end. Have fun.
